and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.11.3] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed
- **Stale folder references in docs** — replaced legacy Obsidian-style paths (`01 Daily Logs/`, `02 Projects/`, `05 Financeiro/`, `09 Estrategia/`) with new `workspace/` structure (`workspace/daily-logs/`, `workspace/projects/`, `workspace/finance/`, `workspace/strategy/`) in `CLAUDE.md`, status command, creating-skills/routines/updating guides, ops-vendor-review skill, and `llms-full.txt`.

### Changed
- **`.gitignore`** — added `config/triggers.yaml` to gitignored configs.

## [0.11.2] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **SECURITY.md** — vulnerability disclosure policy with private reporting channels and contributor security guidelines

### Fixed
- **Command injection in dashboard backend** — replaced all `subprocess.run(..., shell=True)` with argument-list invocations across `systems.py`, `services.py`, and `tasks.py`; added container name validation and path traversal protection
- **WebSocket authentication bypass** — terminal WebSocket handler now verifies `current_user.is_authenticated` (previously skipped `before_request` middleware)
- **Code injection in MemPalace mining** — replaced f-string quote interpolation with `repr()` to prevent Python code injection via crafted path/wing values
- **Path traversal in MemPalace sources** — source paths now validated against home directory and workspace boundaries

## [0.11.1] - 2026-04-09

### Changed
- **Rebrand OpenClaude → EvoNexus** — full platform rename across ~80 files: docs, dashboard, CLI, site, templates, skills, agents, Docker, env vars (`OPENCLAUDE_PORT` → `EVONEXUS_PORT`), npm package (`@evoapi/evo-nexus`), GitHub repo (`EvolutionAPI/evo-nexus`), cover SVG, and all internal references.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Workspace backup & restore** — new `backup.py` script that exports all gitignored user data (memory, agent-memory, config, dashboard DB, logs, custom agents/commands/templates/routines, `.env`) as a ZIP with manifest. Supports local storage (`backups/`) and S3-compatible cloud buckets. Restore with merge (skip existing) or replace (overwrite) mode.
- **Daily Backup routine** — core routine (`ADWs/routines/backup.py`) runs at 21:00 daily via scheduler. Pure Python (systematic, no AI, no tokens). Auto-uploads to S3 if `BACKUP_S3_BUCKET` is configured.
- **Backup dashboard page** — `/backups` page to list, create, download, restore, and delete backups from the browser. Shows S3 config status, backup metadata from manifest, and restore mode selection modal.
- **Trigger registry** — reactive event triggers (webhook & event-based) that execute skills or routines in response to external events. Supports GitHub, Stripe, Linear, Telegram, Discord, and custom webhooks with HMAC signature validation.
- **Triggers dashboard page** — `/triggers` page to create, edit, delete, test, enable/disable triggers. Copy webhook URL, regenerate secrets, view execution history.
- **`trigger-registry` skill** — CLI skill to create, manage, and test triggers.
- **Resume Claude sessions in chat** — dashboard chat now lists active/resumable Claude sessions with `--resume` support.
- **Makefile targets** — `make backup`, `make backup-s3`, `make restore`, `make backup-list`, `make backup-daily`.
- **S3 backup env vars** — `BACKUP_S3_BUCKET`, `BACKUP_S3_PREFIX`, `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL` in `.env.example`.

### Changed
- **Core routines** — 5 → 6 (Daily Backup added)
- **Dashboard screenshots** — all page screenshots optimized (50-70% smaller file sizes)
- **ROUTINES.md** — added Triggers and Daily Backup documentation sections
- **docs/** — updated core-routines, makefile reference, env-variables reference, dashboard overview

## [0.10.1] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed
- **Site and docs counts** — updated all references from 9/10 agents to 16, from ~68/~80 skills to ~130, across site Home page, introduction, architecture, getting-started, using-agents, initial-setup, dashboard overview, and evolution-foundation case study
- **Site Home features** — added Channels, Agent Teams, and Scheduled Tasks to the features grid; updated agent showcase to show all 16 agents
- **Channels docs in pt-BR** — rewrote `docs/guides/channels.md` and `docs/guides/channels-reference.md` to English (docs should always be in English)
- **README screenshots** — restored screenshots section using HTML `<img>` tags with consistent sizing (were broken by markdown table layout)

## [0.10.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **6 new core agents** — Mako (Marketing), Aria (HR/People), Zara (Customer Success), Lex (Legal/Compliance), Nova (Product), Dex (Data/BI). Each with system prompt, slash command, dashboard card with icon and color, and dedicated skills.
- **~80 new skills** — HR (`hr-*`), Legal (`legal-*`), Ops (`ops-*`), Product Management (`pm-*`), Customer Success (`cs-*`), Data/BI (`data-*`), Marketing (`mkt-*`). Skill count: ~68 → ~180.
- **Channels** — bidirectional chat bridges that push messages into a running Claude Code session. Discord and iMessage channels added alongside existing Telegram. Each runs as a background screen session.
- **Channel documentation** — `docs/guides/channels.md` (setup guide for all 3 channels) and `docs/guides/channels-reference.md` (technical reference for building custom channels/webhooks).
- **Dashboard channels section** — Services page now shows "Channels" as a separate section with Telegram, Discord Channel, and iMessage Channel cards (Start/Stop/Logs).
- **Agent documentation** — individual doc pages for all 16 agents in `docs/agents/`.
- **Makefile targets** — `discord-channel`, `discord-channel-stop`, `discord-channel-attach`, `imessage`, `imessage-stop`, `imessage-attach`.

### Changed
- **Agent count** — 10 → 16 core agents across README, docs, dashboard, and rules
- **Skill count** — ~68 → ~180 across README, docs, and dashboard
- **Dashboard AGENT_META** — all 16 agents now have dedicated icons, colors, and command badges
- **README** — updated architecture diagram, agent list, skill count, dashboard features, and workspace structure

## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Custom agents** — user-created agents with `custom-` prefix. Gitignored, auto-discovered by dashboard (gray "custom" badge vs green "core" badge). Backend returns `custom`, `color`, `model` fields from frontmatter.
- **Oracle agent** — 10th core agent. `/oracle` workspace knowledge agent that answers questions about agents, skills, routines, integrations, and configuration by reading the actual documentation. No RAG needed — reads `docs/llms-full.txt` and source files directly.
- **`create-agent` skill** — conversational interface to create custom agents (name, domain, personality, model, color, memory folder, slash command)
- **`create-command` skill** — conversational interface to create standalone slash commands for Claude Code

### Changed
- **Agent count** — 9 → 10 core agents (Oracle added) across README, docs, and rules
- **Dashboard Agents page** — core/custom badges, dynamic colors from frontmatter for custom agents, separate core/custom counters in stats bar
- **Documentation** — updated agents overview, creating-agents guide (core vs custom section), skills overview

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Scheduled Tasks** — new one-off task scheduling system. Schedule a skill, prompt, or script to run at a specific date/time without creating a full routine. Dashboard page at `/tasks` with create/edit/cancel/run-now/view-result. API CRUD at `/api/tasks`. Scheduler checks pending tasks every 30 seconds.
- **`schedule-task` skill** — conversational interface to create scheduled tasks ("agendar pra sexta 10h", "schedule this for tomorrow")
- **Dynamic routine discovery** — `ROUTINE_SCRIPTS` and `SCRIPT_AGENTS` are no longer hardcoded. Agent and script mappings are built dynamically by scanning `ADWs/routines/` scripts and extracting metadata from docstrings (`via AgentName` pattern). New scripts are auto-discovered.
- **`make run R=<id>`** — generic dynamic runner for any routine (core or custom)
- **`make list-routines`** — lists all discovered routines with agent, script, and name
- **Workspace file browser** — reports page replaced with a full file browser that navigates workspace folders

### Changed
- **Makefile cleaned** — custom routine targets (user-specific) removed from Makefile. Only core routine targets remain (`morning`, `eod`, `memory`, `memory-lint`, `weekly`). Custom routines run via `make run R=<id>`.
- **`ROUTINES.md`** — expanded with scheduled tasks docs, dynamic discovery, and updated manual execution section
- **Documentation** — new `docs/routines/scheduled-tasks.md`, updated makefile reference, dashboard overview, creating-routines guide, and skills overview

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Systematic routines** — new `run_script()` function in `ADWs/runner.py` for pure Python routines that run without Claude CLI, without AI, without tokens. Same logging/metrics infrastructure, but cost=$0 and duration in seconds instead of minutes.
- **`create-routine` skill updated** — now asks "AI or systematic?" and generates the correct script pattern. For systematic routines, Claude writes the Python logic once at creation time, then the script runs on its own forever.
- **Example routine** — `ADWs/routines/examples/log_cleanup.py` demonstrates the systematic pattern (deletes logs older than 30 days)
- **"systematic" badge** — dashboard Scheduler and Routines pages show a gray "systematic" badge for system routines instead of green `@agent`
- **Site docs CSS overhaul** — replaced fragile custom marked renderers with CSS-based styling on `.docs-content`. Tables, lists, code blocks, and all markdown elements now render correctly with the dark theme.
- **OAuth redirect URLs** — documented redirect URIs for YouTube, Instagram, and LinkedIn OAuth setup

### Changed
- **ROADMAP** — "Agent-less routines" marked as done

## [0.6.1] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Core routines documentation** (`docs/routines/core-routines.md`) — detailed explanation of all 5 core routines: what they do, why they matter, and how they form the daily loop
- **Memory Lint promoted to core** — moved from `ADWs/routines/custom/` to `ADWs/routines/`, hardcoded in `scheduler.py` (Sunday 09:00). Now 5 core routines instead of 4
- **Release skill** now syncs screenshots (`public/print-*.png` → `site/public/assets/`) on every release

### Changed
- **Dashboard pages redesigned** — 12 pages (Audit, Config, Costs, Files, Integrations, Memory, Reports, Roles, Routines, Scheduler, Skills, Systems, Templates, Users) with consistent dark theme and improved UX
- **Integration count** — 19 → 17 (removed internal-only Licensing and WhatsApp docs from public documentation)
- **Memory system** — LLM Wiki pattern: ingest propagation, weekly lint, centralized index, and operation log

### Removed
- **`docs/integrations/licensing.md`** — internal only, not public
- **`docs/integrations/whatsapp.md`** — internal only, not public

### Fixed
- **Dashboard build** — removed unused `totalTokens` variable in Costs page that blocked TypeScript compilation

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Evolution API skill** (`int-evolution-api`) — 33 commands: instances, messages (text, media, location, contact, buttons, lists, polls), chats, groups, webhooks
- **Evolution Go skill** (`int-evolution-go`) — 24 commands: instances, messages, reactions, presence
- **Evo CRM skill** (`int-evo-crm`) — 48 commands: contacts, conversations, messages, inboxes, pipelines, labels
- **Integration docs** — 3 new guides: `docs/integrations/evolution-api.md`, `evolution-go.md`, `evo-crm.md`
- **Dashboard integrations** — Evolution API, Evolution Go, and Evo CRM cards on Integrations page
- **`.env.example`** — added `EVOLUTION_API_URL/KEY`, `EVOLUTION_GO_URL/KEY`, `EVO_CRM_URL/TOKEN`

### Changed
- **Integration count** — 16 → 17 across README, site, and docs (removed internal-only Licensing and WhatsApp docs)
- **Community members** — 7,000+ → 17,000+ on site
- **v0.4 roadmap complete** — all 13 items done, Evolution product skills was the last one

## [0.5.1] - 2026-04-09

### Changed
- **Docs markdown rendering** — replaced regex parser with `marked` library. Code blocks, ASCII art, and nested formatting now render correctly on the site.
- **README and site** — `npx @evoapi/evo-nexus` is now the primary install method. Git clone shown as alternative.
- **Release skill** — `make docs-build` and frontend rebuild are now mandatory on every release (not conditional).

### Fixed
- **Site /docs navigation** — nested doc pages (e.g., `/docs/guides/creating-routines`) no longer 404. Switched from `useRoute` wildcard to direct URL parsing.
- **Site route matching** — changed from `/docs/:slug+` to `/docs/*` for reliable wouter matching.
- **CLI default directory** — `npx @evoapi/evo-nexus` without args now clones into current directory (`.`), not a subfolder.
- **Site CI build** — added missing `print-agents.png` to site assets.
- **Docs sync** — site now serves updated docs matching the repo (was stale).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Active agent visualization** — Claude Code hooks (`PreToolUse`, `Stop`) track agent launches in `agent-status.json`. Dashboard polls `/api/agents/active` and shows animated "RUNNING" badges on agent cards and overview.
- **Agents page redesign** — unique icons and accent colors per agent, slash command badges, memory count pills, status dots, hover glow effects.
- **Overview page redesign** — stat cards with icons and trend indicators, active agents bar, quick actions row (Morning Briefing, Chat, Costs, GitHub), improved reports and routines tables with relative timestamps.
- **Claude Code hooks** — `agent-tracker.sh` hook registered in `settings.json` for real-time agent activity tracking.
- **Project settings.json** — permissions (allow/deny rules), hooks configuration.
- **Inner-loop commands** — `/status` (workspace status) and `/review` (recent changes + next actions).
- **Default system: Claude Status** — `seed_systems()` creates Anthropic status page as default external system on first boot.
- **Public roadmap** — `ROADMAP.md` with community input via GitHub discussions.

### Changed
- **CLAUDE.md split** — reduced from 263 to 128 lines. Detailed config moved to `.claude/rules/` (agents, integrations, routines, skills) — auto-loaded by Claude Code.
- **All 9 agent prompts generalized** — removed hardcoded personal references (Omie, Linear, Discord Evolution, Brazilian formats, etc.). User-specific context preserved in `_improvements.md` per agent memory folder.
- **Rules and commands translated** — all `.claude/rules/` and `.claude/commands/` files translated from Portuguese to English.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Docker Compose for dashboard** — `Dockerfile.dashboard` (multi-stage: node + python) + `docker-compose.yml` with dashboard, telegram, and runner services. `make docker-dashboard` to start.
- **Dashboard CI** — GitHub Actions workflow builds and pushes dashboard image to `ghcr.io/evolutionapi/evo-nexus/dashboard` on push/release
- **npm CI** — GitHub Actions workflow publishes CLI to npm on release (requires `NPM_TOKEN` secret)

### Changed
- **Sidebar reorganized** — 5 collapsible groups (Main, Operations, Data, System, Admin) with collapse state persisted in localStorage
- **Scheduler removed from docker-compose** — runs embedded in dashboard, not as separate service
- **`make docker-up` → `make docker-telegram`** — reflects that only Telegram is a separate Docker service
- **Public roadmap updated** — removed internal Future/Research section, marked completed items

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **CLI installer** — `npx @evoapi/evo-nexus` clones repo, checks prerequisites, installs deps, runs setup wizard, and builds dashboard
- **Version indicator in dashboard** — sidebar footer shows current version; `/api/version/check` compares against latest GitHub release with 1h cache
- **Public roadmap** — `ROADMAP.md` with 4 phases (v0.4 → Future), community input via GitHub discussions
- **Update guide** — `docs/guides/updating.md` with git pull, Docker, and custom content preservation instructions

### Changed
- **Privacy-first licensing** — removed heartbeat thread, deactivate endpoint, and shutdown hook. Only initial registration remains (who installed). No monitoring, no kill switch, no telemetry.
- **Licensing version** — now reads from `pyproject.toml` dynamically instead of hardcoded constant

### Fixed
- **nginx 403 on `/docs/`** — removed `$uri/` from `try_files` so directory paths fall through to SPA instead of returning Forbidden
- **`.gitignore` formatting** — `site/lib/` and `mempalace.yaml` were concatenated on one line
- **User-specific files removed from git** — `mempalace.yaml` and `entities.json` no longer tracked

## [0.3.2] - 2026-04-08

### Added
- **Docs page on site** (`/docs`) — full documentation viewer with sidebar, search, and markdown rendering
- **Auto-version system** — `pyproject.toml` is single source of truth, injected into site (Vite `__APP_VERSION__`), dashboard (`/api/version`), and CI (Docker build-arg)
- **Pre-build docs index** — `scripts/build-docs-index.mjs` generates `docs-index.json` at build time
- **`/api/version` endpoint** — dashboard serves current version from `pyproject.toml`

### Changed
- **`make docs-build`** — now also syncs `docs/` to `site/public/docs/`
- **Docs links** in landing page point to `/docs` (internal route, not dashboard)
- **Site version badge** — reads from `pyproject.toml` dynamically instead of hardcoded

## [0.3.1] - 2026-04-08

### Added
- **Landing page** (`site/`) — standalone React + Vite static site, extracted from Replit monorepo

### Changed
- **`.gitignore` updated** — site tracked in repo (Replit artifacts, node_modules, dist excluded)
- **Site assets renamed** — clean filenames (`logo.png`, `print-overview.png`, etc.) instead of Replit hashes

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-08

### Added
- **Public Documentation** (`/docs`) — full docs site inside the dashboard, accessible without auth
- **MemPalace** — semantic knowledge base with ChromaDB for code/doc search (optional)

- **llms-full.txt** — served as static pre-generated file (instant load, no on-the-fly concatenation)
- **i18n** — final cleanup, 18 files translated from Portuguese to English

### Fixed
