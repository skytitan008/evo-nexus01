# Automated Routines

Guide to all workspace routines, their schedules, and responsible agents.

---

> **Core vs Custom Routines**
>
> Routines are split into two directories:
> - **`ADWs/routines/`** — 7 core routines that ship with the repo (morning, eod, dashboard, review, triage, sync, memory).
> - **`ADWs/routines/custom/`** — ~20 custom routines created per-workspace (community, finance, social, licensing, etc.). This directory is **gitignored** — custom routines are user-specific and not tracked in version control.
>
> When creating new routines, place them in `ADWs/routines/custom/`.

## How It Works

Each routine is an ADW (AI Developer Workflow) in `ADWs/routines/` that:
1. Calls Claude Code CLI with the **correct agent** (`--agent`)
2. Executes the **corresponding skill** (structured prompt)
3. Shows **real-time output** in terminal (Rich)
4. Saves **structured logs** in `ADWs/logs/` (JSONL + detailed)

## Logs

```bash
make logs          # Latest JSONL entries
make logs-detail   # List detailed logs
make logs-tail     # Show latest full log
make clean-logs    # Remove logs older than 30 days
```
